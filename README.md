Populism at the country level is at an all-time high, with more than 25 percent of nations currently governed by populists. How do economies perform under populist leaders? We build a new long-run cross-country database to study the macroeconomic history of populism. We identify 51 populist presidents and prime ministers from 1900 to 2020 and show that the economic cost of populism is high. After 15 years, GDP per capita is 10 percent lower compared to a plausible nonpopulist counterfactual. Economic disintegration, decreasing macroeconomic stability, and the erosion of institutions typically go hand in hand with populist rule.}
For a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis that matches treated and control units based on their propensity scores without individually pairing each treated unit with a control unit, I used the causalml library, which provides a more direct way to perform PSM, including many-to-one matches. This approach is helpful when you don't need to manually identify individual pairs but still want to assess the overall effect of the treatment.
This approach simplifies the matching process by leveraging causalml's NearestNeighborMatch, which automatically handles the matching based on the specified propensity scores. Ensure you have a clear treatment definition and that your outcome variable is correctly specified for your analysis beyond the PSM step.
